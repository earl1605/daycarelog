# DaycareLog — Android

Kotlin + Jetpack Compose (Material 3) Android client for DaycareLog, a daycare management system for tracking children, attendance, health records, and reports. Talks to the same [Spring Boot backend](../backend) REST API as the [web client](../web), so data is shared across both.

## Tech stack

- **Kotlin** + **Jetpack Compose** (Material 3; manual light/dark mode toggle in Settings — no Android system dynamic/wallpaper-based theming)
- **Navigation Compose** — in-app routing
- **Retrofit** + **Gson** — REST API client
- **Jetpack DataStore (Preferences)** — persisted auth token/user session
- **Coroutines** — async work

## Requirements

- Android Studio (or the Gradle wrapper + Android SDK on the command line)
- The Gradle toolchain is deliberately pinned to versions compatible with **Android Studio Iguana (2023.2.1)** — AGP 8.3.2, Gradle 8.4, Kotlin 1.9.22, Compose Compiler 1.5.10 — rather than the latest available versions.

## Run

Open `mobile/` in Android Studio and run the `app` configuration, or from the command line:

```bash
cd mobile
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The app points at the production backend URL by default — see `RetrofitClient.kt` to point it at a local backend instead.

## Notable behavior

- **Navigation**: `MainScreen.kt` wraps the app in a `ModalNavigationDrawer` grouped into Main / Management / Admin sections for Admin/Staff/Teacher, or a read-only Parent section for the `parent` role, matching the [web sidebar](../web)'s design. Every top-level screen has a menu icon to reopen the drawer.
- **Theming**: a manual light/dark mode toggle (`ThemeState.kt`, DataStore-persisted, survives sign-out) drives a `rememberScreenPalette()` helper threaded through every screen's cards/rows, mirroring the web app's two-tier light/dark surface design.
- **Guardians & Parent portal**: Admin/Staff manage guardians per child (`GuardiansSection`) or via a standalone directory (`GuardiansScreen`), optionally creating a `parent`-role portal login tied to one or more children. Parent users only see the read-only Dashboard/Attendance/Health screens under `ui/parent/`, sourced from `/mine` endpoints resolved server-side from the JWT.
- **Attendance**: restricted to weekdays (Monday–Friday) — the date picker defaults to the nearest weekday and rejects weekend dates before submission.
- **Name fields**: First/Last/Middle Name inputs on Registration and the Settings profile form auto-capitalize each word as you type (`util/TextUtils.kt`, shared by both screens), via `KeyboardCapitalization.Words` plus a `capitalizeWords()` pass before saving — without overriding intentional casing like "McDonald" or disturbing cursor position mid-edit.
- **Auth**: JWT + user JSON persisted in DataStore; `NavGraph.kt` checks for a saved token on launch to decide between the Login screen and the main app.
- **Gotcha**: `painterResource()` cannot load `<adaptive-icon>` mipmap resources (e.g. `R.mipmap.ic_launcher_round`) — throws at runtime, not compile time. Use a plain vector `drawable` instead (see `R.drawable.ic_child`, used for the drawer logo and Login screen icon).
